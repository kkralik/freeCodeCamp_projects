* My code in the provided test settings: https://replit.com/@kkralik/boilerplate-time-calculator-1#time_calculator.py

## Brief description:
The code contains a function add_time, which says what time will it be when provided number of hours passes from the initial time.

```
add_time("11:43 PM", "24:20", "tueSday")
