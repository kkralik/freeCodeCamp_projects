# freeCodeCamp.org
An amazing free resource for learning various programming languages.

For obtaining a certification, the user (pupil) is required to complete several projects which run through automated tests.
There is plenty of resources and small exercises provided, and users are encouraged to use the forum for advice.
Each certification is estimated to take 300 hours for going through the resources and finishing the projects.

Currently (2021/05) they offer 10 free certifications. I highly recommend the site for learning, practice and the community.

## My projects
All of my projects published in this repository were completed as a part of obtaining one of the certifications.
If there is code which was provided with the guidelines, it is clearly labelled with a commentary.
Feel free to contact me if you find any issues with the files.
