## Introduction
This is my submitted code for finishing one of the projects on <a href = https://www.freecodecamp.org/> freeCodeCamp.org </a>

* Certification name: Scientific Computing with Python
* Task name: <b> Polygon Area Calculator </b>
* My code in the provided test settings: https://replit.com/@kkralik/boilerplate-polygon-area-calculator-1#shape_calculator.py

## Brief description:
The code contains classes Rectangle and Square with a few methods, which can calculate basic information about the shape from provided dimensions.

example:

```
sq = shape_calculator.Square(9)
sq.set_side(4)
print(sq.get_diagonal())
print(sq)
print(sq.get_picture())
```

would lead to output:
```
5.656854249492381
Square(side=4)
