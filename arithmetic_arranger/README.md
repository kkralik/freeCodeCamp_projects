## Introduction
This is my submitted code for finishing one of the projects on <a href = https://www.freecodecamp.org/> freeCodeCamp.org </a>

* Certification name: Scientific Computing with Python
* Task name: <b> Arithmetic Formatter </b>
* My code in the provided test settings: https://replit.com/@kkralik/boilerplate-arithmetic-formatter-2#arithmetic_arranger.py

## Brief description:
The code contains a function arithmetic_arranger, which reformats simple mathematical expressions to an easy-to-read, primary school type of form.

example:

```
arithmetic_arranger(["32 + 8", "1 - 3801", "9999 + 9999", "523 - 49"], True)
```

would lead to output:
```
  32         1      9999      523
+  8    - 3801    + 9999    -  49
----    ------    ------    -----
  40     -3800     19998      474
```
